# iOSApp
## Introduction
This is a app made for the iPhone, where the user inputs a video streaming URL in the HLS format along with a URL to a server parsing the JSON data. Since the project is lacking a real server at the moment, the functionality has not been implemented to support connecting to a real server for the JSON data. So in the current state, simply leave the JSON textfield empty to use  the localhost. The project can be used with a JSON dummy server to parse sample data. 

The dummy server can be launched by navigating into the JsonServer folder in the terminal and executing this command: "json-server --watch db.json". To install the Json dummy server, simply execute the command "npm install -g json-server" in the terminal.
