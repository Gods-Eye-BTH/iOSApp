# iOSApp

This is a app made for the iPhone, where the user inputs a video streaming URL in the HLS format along with a URL to a server parsing the JSON data. Since the project is lacking a real server at the moment, the functionality has not been implemented to support connecting to a real server for the JSON data. So in the current state, simply leave the JSON-url empty to use it the local host. The project can be used with a JSON dummy server to parse sample data.
